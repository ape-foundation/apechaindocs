# Analytics

## Sequence

Sequence’s [analytics](https://docs.sequence.xyz/solutions/builder/analytics) feature allows users to easily track key metrics without additional work. By using Sequence SDKs/APIs, analytics events are sent to Databeat for real-time storage and visualization.

When you use Sequence, via our SDKs, to build your application, you can see key insights in Sequence Builder. You don’t need to do any additional work to see valuable metrics about your project, such as the number of connected wallets, active users or daily transaction requests.

When requests are made with Sequence SDKs/APIs, analytics events are fired and sent to our internal analytics system, Databeat. Databeat anonymizes the data and stores it in a secure database designed for high-volume, real-time applications. The metrics can be queried from the database, in real-time, for your project and presented in insightful visualizations.
