# Foundry
## What is Foundry?


Foundry is a Rust-based toolset for Ethereum development that helps developers manage dependencies, compile projects, run tests, deploy contracts, and interact with blockchains via the command line interface.

This tutorial will guide you through deploying and interacting with a smart contract on Apechain using Foundry.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Adding Apechain Testnet to MetaMask:**
    - You can find and add chain details [here](https://curtis.hub.caldera.xyz/) to your MetaMask.
- **Obtaining Test ETH (Sepolia) and Bridging to Apechain Testnet:**
    - Visit the [Hub](https://curtis.hub.caldera.xyz/)
    - Click on ‚ÄúFaucet‚Äù
    - Enter your wallet address
    - Click on "Request‚Äù
- **Required Installations:**
    - Node, NPM
    - Basic knowledge of React.js and Solidity

## Get Started with Foundry

Installing Foundry is simple. For MacOS and Linux, run the following command:


### **Linux or MacOS:**

```jsx
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash foundryup

```

<CodeSnippet code={`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash foundryup`} />




### Windows:

```jsx
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh

cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry foundry-cli anvil --bins --locked
```

## **Create a Project**

Once we have Foundry installed, the next step is to initialize a new project.

```jsx
forge init foundry
```

Navigate to the source folder and Create a Smart Contract File:

```jsx
cd src

touch MyToken.sol
```

## **Write Your Smart Contract**

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract HelloApe {
    string public greeting = "Hello, Ape!";

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }
}
```

## **Compile Contract**

After writing our smart contract the next thing is to compile it and to do that we are going to copy and paste the command below into our terminal, please make sure you are in the projects root directory.

```jsx
forge build
```

If it compiles with no errors, the contract is correct, and we are ready to deploy it to Apechain.


## **Smart Contract Deployment on Apechain**

When deploying smart contract to any chain, you need to pay deployment gas fee using the chains native token and it is no different for Apechain, before deploying to Apechain you need to make sure that you've acquired $APE testnet tokens.

You can deploy on Apechain by running forge create, followed by the RPC URL, your wallet's private key, and the source of your smart contract.

```jsx
forge create --rpc-url "https://curtis.rpc.caldera.xyz/http" --private-key `your-private-key` src/FileName.sol:ContractName
```

You should see a response similar to the one below:

![Alt Text](../../images/foundry-terminal.png)

Congrats üéâ üéä  you just deployed your smart contract to Apechain! Copy out the smart contract address ‚ÄúDeployed to‚Äù we‚Äôre going to be needing it on our React project.

## **Verify smart contract deployment**

Visit [Apechain‚Äôs explorer](https://curtis.explorer.caldera.xyz/), copy and paste your contract address into the search bar and you should be able to see your smart contract and all related transactions.

## Interacting with the Smart Contract

We are now done with the creation and deployment of our smart contract. Now it's time to build a simple ReactJS app.

```jsx
npx create-react-app my-dapp
```

## **Install ethers.js**

Ethers.js is a library that facilitates interaction between web applications and the blockchain.

On your terminal, navigate to the folder of the React Project you just created and run the command below.

```jsx
npm install ethers
```

## **Declare Contract Address and ABI**

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a crucial component in Ethereum smart contracts, serving as a method selector. It defines the specific functions and data structures that can be invoked on a smart contract, enabling interaction between the contract and external applications.

You can get your smart contract‚Äôs ABI once your contract builds successfully, to locate it, navigate to you out folder, you‚Äôll see a folder with the same name as your solidity file, expand the folder and you‚Äôll see a JSON file copy the JSON file and paste into the root folder of your ReactJS project.

## **Code the UI**

Now that we have our ABI file and ethers.js installed, the next step is to build our UI.
but how you choose to build your UI is entirely up to you and the purpose of your app but for this guide, we are just going to have a UI with a simple button and text to display the message returned by our smart contract.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import ABI from "./HelloWorld.json";

function App() {
  const [provider, setProvider] = useState(null);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState(null);
  const contractAddress = "YOUR-DEPLOYED-SMART-CONTRACT-ADDRESS";

  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      if (window.ethereum) {
        const initializeProvider = async () => {
          if (window.ethereum) {
            await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
            const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
            setProvider(provider);
          }
        };

        initializeProvider();
      } else {
        console.error("Please install MetaMask!");
      }
    }
  }, []);

  const greet = async () => {
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, ABI.abi, provider);
    const result = await contract.greet();
    setMessage(result);
    console.log(result);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Apechain</h1>
      <button onClick={greet}>Interact with Contract</button>
      <h3>{message}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the above code we imported useEffect, useState, etherjs and our ABI JSON file, next we set our provider and message state and our contract address, after that, we initialized our provider inside of a useEffect so that it gets initialized as soon as the page loads, below that we have our greet function which creates a new instance of our deployed contract using the contractAddress, ABI and the provider we initialized earlier, after which we then hit the greet function we wrote in our smart contract and then set it to our message state so we can render it on the screen.

## **Run the Project**

```jsx
npm start
```

## **Conclusion**

This tutorial covered deploying and interacting with a smart contract on Apechain using Foundry. We installed Foundry, created a project, wrote and compiled a smart contract, and deployed it on Apechain. We then created a React app to interact with the contract using ethers.js.
