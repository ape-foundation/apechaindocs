## Dune Sim

[Dune's Sim APIs](https://sim.dune.com/) provide a comprehensive toolkit for developers needing fast, reliable access to realtime, EVM and SVM blockchain data. Engineered for speed and an optimal developer experience, Sim APIs offer an intuitive way to query extensive onchain information through straightforward REST APIs:

- [Activity API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity): Access a chronological feed of onchain activity for any EVM address, including transfers and decoded contract interactions.
- [Balances API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/balances): Retrieve realtime native and ERC20 token balances, complete with metadata and USD valuations.
- [Token Info API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/token-info): Obtain detailed metadata and realtime price information for native assets or ERC20 tokens.
- [Collectibles API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/collectibles): Fetch NFT (ERC721 and ERC1155) balances and their attributes for an address.
- [Transactions API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/transactions): Get granular details for specific transactions, including block information and gas data.
- [Token Holders API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/token-holders): Discover token distribution for ERC20 or ERC721 tokens, ranked by wallet value.

In partnership with ApeChain, Dune's Sim APIs give developers direct and powerful access to ApeChain's onchain data. This enables ApeChain developers to efficiently build and enhance a variety of apps, from advanced wallets and dApps to sophisticated analytical tools, by using realtime insights into token balances, NFT data, account activity, transaction specifics, and detailed token metadata directly from the ApeChain network.
