# Yield Modes

### Rebasing Mechanism

ApeChain's yield-bearing tokens, such as apeUSD and apeETH, support a rebasing mode where users’ balances increase periodically in line with the yield generated by the underlying assets. For example, apeUSD balances will grow in real-time with sDAI yield, reflecting the underlying DAI accrual on Ethereum.

## Scaling & Security

### Aspect | Details

| Aspect      | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Scalability | The on-chain logic for yield routes is generalized, allowing it to scale efficiently with increased volume and new yield-bearing tokens. |
| Security    | Yield-bearing tokens are pegged to underlying rebasing assets, ensuring no risk of undercollateralization (e.g., 1 apeUSD = 1 sDAI). |
| Security Dependencies | Security relies on the underlying smart contract risk of yield protocols and the Decent wrapper. |
| Messaging Security | Messaging between chains is managed securely via LayerZero. |

### Canonical Bridging

ApeChain will utilize two canonical bridge routes:

| Bridge Route   | Purpose |
| -------------- | ------- |
| LayerLeap      | For native yield from Ethereum. |
| Standard Orbit | From Arbitrum, offering an alternative for bridging, especially for non-yield-bearing ERC20 tokens. |

## Basic and Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements

| Requirement            | Details |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| Supported Assets       | Users can deposit APE, USD stablecoins, and ETH on ApeChain to generate native yield. |
| Rebasing Mode          | All yielding assets must support rebasing, ensuring users do not need to manually claim their yield. |
| Cross-Chain Deposits/Withdrawals | Assets can be deposited from and withdrawn to Ethereum mainnet. |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement                | Details |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Decentralized Yield Sources | Yield must be generated from credibly decentralized sources. |
| Decentralized System Control | The yield system's operation and governance must be decentralized. |
| APE Yield via ApeStake     | The current ApeStake mechanism will be used to generate yield for ApeCoin without modifications. |
| Risk Management            | The system should not expose users to risks beyond the inherent smart contract risks of the underlying protocols. |

## Yield Sources and Mechanisms

| Yield Type  | Mechanism | Governance |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| DAI Yield   | Stablecoins bridged into ApeChain are converted to DAI and deposited into sDAI, accumulating yield based on the MakerDAO savings rate. | Governed by DAI’s governance processes. |
| Lido Yield (ETH) | ETH bridged into ApeChain is deposited into Lido to generate yield, utilizing wstETH to align with rebasing token behavior. | Due to Lido's withdrawal delay, users can either swap Lido ETH to native ETH via a DEX aggregator or withdraw as stETH directly. |
| Ape Yield   | ApeCoin deposited into ApeChain is staked via ApeStake, with yield distributed based on the user’s share of tokens in the pool. | Yield must be claimed via a discrete contract call, managed by the bridge contract. |

## Rates

<Callout type="info"> These rates current as of October 25th 2024 </Callout>

| Token | Yield Rate |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| APE   | 12%                  |
| ETH   | 2.5%                 |
| USD   | 6%                   |

## Rebasing Modes

ApeChain will support three configurable rebasing modes for yield-generating tokens:

| Rebasing Mode | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Void          | No yield is earned; the balance remains unchanged. |
| Automatic     | The balance automatically increases as yield is earned. |
| Claimable     | Yield accumulates separately and can be claimed, but the balance remains unchanged. |

## Conclusion

ApeChain’s native yield system represents a significant advancement in the space, providing a decentralized, automated yield mechanism for bridged assets. By leveraging established protocols, ApeChain ensures sustainable yields and user-friendly operation through careful governance. This spec overview should serve as a guide, enabling developers and users to effectively interact with the native yield system as ApeChain continues to evolve.
