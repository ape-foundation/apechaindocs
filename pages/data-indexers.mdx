## Sequence

The [Sequence Indexer](https://docs.sequence.xyz/api-references/indexer/overview) is a powerful tool that can be used to build wallets, games, and dapps that
need to query on-chain data. In addition, it utilizes built in-house, next-generation, LSM-tree
based databases to store the data. It makes it super fast to query and index data. The data is
available in real-time with low latency. You can query it using a simple REST API or one of our SDKs. The Indexer API allows you to query all token balances, history and other information for
all Ethereum compatible chains. In order to make it one go to place for all your token data needs,
we have included [Sequence Metadata](https://docs.sequence.xyz/api-references/metadata/overview) support for all tokens. This means that
you can easily render tokens in your apps, games, or wallets without the need to fetch metadata from
a separate API.

## Reservoir

[Reservoir](https://reservoir.tools/) offers APIs and tools for seamless NFT trading, data access, and marketplace integration, making it easy for developers to add NFT features like buying, selling, and real-time market data to their apps.

In collaboration with ApeChain, Reservoir provides the necessary tools for NFT trading and data management, enabling developers to efficiently build and run NFT marketplaces. This partnership enhances ApeChain's capabilities for cross-marketplace trading, aggregated liquidity, and advanced data analytics, supporting the growing demand for NFTs and Web3 gaming.

## Etherscan

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is working with ApeChain by supporting contract verification and blockchain exploration for our L3 network. 

This integration not only helps ensure contract authenticity, but also provides developers with the tools they need to interact with the ApeChain network efficiently. By setting up custom network configurations, ApeChain can leverage Etherscan’s tools for tracking transactions, managing contracts, and ensuring activities on the chain are visible and verifiable​.
