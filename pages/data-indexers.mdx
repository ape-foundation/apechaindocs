# Data Indexers

## Sequence

The [Sequence Indexer](https://docs.sequence.xyz/api-references/indexer/overview) is a powerful tool that can be used to build wallets, games, and dapps that
need to query on-chain data. In addition, it utilizes built in-house, next-generation, LSM-tree
based databases to store the data. It makes it super fast to query and index data. The data is
available in real-time with low latency. You can query it using a simple REST API or one of our SDKs. The Indexer API allows you to query all token balances, history and other information for
all Ethereum compatible chains. In order to make it one go to place for all your token data needs,
we have included [Sequence Metadata](https://docs.sequence.xyz/api-references/metadata/overview) support for all tokens. This means that
you can easily render tokens in your apps, games, or wallets without the need to fetch metadata from
a separate API.
