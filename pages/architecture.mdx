# ApeChain Architecture
## ApeChain at its core is an Arbitrum Orbit L3.

Orbit chains are deployable, configurable instances of the Arbitrum Nitro tech stack that can be tailored precisely to match a project's exact use-case and business needs.
Each Orbit chain is capable of supporting many times the capacity of Ethereum, all while benefitting directly from Ethereum's security.

Orbit Chains can be a Layer 2 (L2) chain which settles directly to Ethereum, or a Layer 3 (L3) chain - like **ApeChain** - which can settle to any Ethereum L2, such as Arbitrum One.

Orbit L3 chains offer:
- **Full EVM equivalance**
- **Anytrust Data Availability for ultra-low-cost transactions**
- **Dedicated throughput and increased gas price reliability**
- **Independence and upgradability**

By settling on Arbitrum One, ApeChain is able to leverage Arbitrum's security and infrastructure, while still maintaining the benefits of being an independent chain. As Arbitrum One is itself settling on and secured by Ethereum, ApeChain is able to benefit from Ethereum's security and liquidity.

## ApeChain is an Optimistic L3

As with all Orbit chains, ApeChain is an Optimistic L3. Blockchain rollups were initially a scaling solution designed to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees on Layer 1 networks like Etherem -- now, rollups as a category encompasses a large, diverse set of chains. They work by bundling or "rolling up" multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then processed and verified on the main chain. This approach moves most of the computational work off-chain while still maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain.

ApeChain's proof system works Optimistically, which means that it assumes that all transactions are valid until proven otherwise. This allows for fast transaction confirmation times, and game theoretic security. Other optimistic chains include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.

## Curtis Testnet
The Curtis Testnet is meant to provide a testing ground for developers and enthusiasts to explore the potential of ApeChain in preparation for Mainnet launch. 

Curtis currently boasts:
- 0.25s **minimum** blocktime
- $APE as a native token
- [Native Bridge](/bridge) to Arbitrum Sepolia
- Functional [Native Yield](/native-yield)
- Fast Withdrawals
