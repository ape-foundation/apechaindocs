## ApeChain Architecture


### Orbit chains offer: ###
- **Full EVM equivalence**
- **Anytrust Data Availability for ultra-low-cost transactions**
- **Dedicated throughput and increased gas price reliability**
- **Independence and upgradability**

By settling on Arbitrum One, ApeChain is able to leverage Arbitrum's security and infrastructure, while still maintaining the benefits of being an independent chain. As Arbitrum One is itself settling on and secured by Ethereum, ApeChain is able to benefit from Ethereum's security and liquidity.

## ApeChain is an Optimistic L3

As with all Orbit chains, ApeChain is an Optimistic L3. Blockchain rollups were initially a scaling solution designed to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees on Layer 1 networks like Ethereum -- now, rollups as a category encompasses a large, diverse set of chains. They work by bundling or "rolling up" multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then processed and verified on the main chain. This approach moves most of the computational work off-chain while still maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain.

ApeChain's proof system works Optimistically, which means that it assumes that all transactions are valid until proven otherwise. This allows for fast transaction confirmation times, and game theoretic security. Other optimistic chains include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.



## ApeChain currently boasts


- 0.25s **minimum** blocktime
- $APE as a native token
- Native Bridge for [Mainnet](https://apechain.com/portal#bridge) and [Testnet](https://curtis.bridge.caldera.xyz/)
- Functional [Native Yield](/native/Overview)
- Fast Withdrawals

## Security Council

ApeChain utilizes a Security Council to address critical risks associated with the ApeChain protocol and its ecosystem. 

The ApeCoin DAO will soon administer Security Council elections, so that the APE community can democratically determine who will be responsible for being vigilant about the security and integrity of the ApeChain protocol.

While this process is being established by the ApeCoin DAO, an interim Security Council has been established, currently consisting of a small group of Ape Foundation and infrastructure partner signers.
