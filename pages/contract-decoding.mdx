# Contract Decoding

Decoding a contract means giving Dune your contract’s ABI, so it can turn raw blockchain data into easy-to-read tables of events and actions. For builders on ApeChain, decoding your contract lets you and others instantly see mints, trades, and user activity in clear dashboards — making your project easier to track, analyze, and showcase across the ApeChain ecosystem.

## Decode your first contract on Dune

1. Go to https://dune.com/contracts/new
2. Select the blockchain where your contract is deployed.
3. In the contract address field, enter your deployed contract address.
4. Give the project a name (e.g., this could be the name of your NFT collection).
5. Leave the contract name as is. Ignore the toggles for "Enable bytecode matching" and "Decode other contracts created by the same factory" if you just want to track the stats of your own contract.
6. Once submitted, it can take up to 24 hours for Dune to complete decoding.
7. If you'd like to learn more about Dune, check out their docs here https://docs.dune.com/home.
