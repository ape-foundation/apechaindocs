# User Onboarding

## Glyph

Glyph is designed to streamline the web3 user experience and onboarding within apps, catering two key audiences: End Users and Builders/Developers (third party apps).

At its core, Glyph functions as an onboarding solution, acting as the central hub for account management, crypto wallet integration, fiat onramping, gas sponsorship (coming soon), and onchain transactions. By utilizing external services and developing a developer-centric widget, this solution ensures we are creating a secure, efficient, and scalable product.

For everyday users, Glyph makes interactions with crypto and blockchain apps easy.

## Sequence

The [Embedded Wallet](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/headless-wallet/quickstart) is designed for a traditional gaming experience. The advantages are:
- Authenticate users with common social providers or email.
- Support for Unity, Unreal, Web, and Mobile.
- Optional pop-ups, modals, and transaction signing for a seamless UX.
- Fully non-custodial, smart contract wallet.
- Out of the box login with [Web SDK](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/web/overview) or build your own flow.

On the other hand, the [Ecosystem Wallet](https://docs.sequence.xyz/solutions/wallets/ecosystem/overview) caters to apps who want to build an entire ecosystem and connect their users to third-party applications such as external marketplaces or DEX's.

Our [Web SDK](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/web/overview) library is a customizable UI written in Typescript, tailored for a browser experience. This is great when you want to support users with existing wallets like Metamask, have an out-of-the-box experience, as well as millions of potential new users who prefer the convenience of social login.

Lastly, we provide [Wallet Linking](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/web/getting-started) for your ecosystem which enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user. Generally, this is a link between an embedded wallet for a game or application and an external wallet, such as Metamask so you can easily query all wallets associated with a single user - across games, ecosystems, and blockchains.
