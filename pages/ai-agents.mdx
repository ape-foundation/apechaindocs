## Flow AI > Ape Agent

[Ape Agent](https://flowai.xyz/agent/apecoin) is an AI agent powered by [Flow AI](https://flowai.xyz) that offers a rich set of tools to interact with the Ape ecosystem, including Apecoin ($APE), ApeChain, BananaBill, and everything related to the Bored Ape Yacht Club. 

It's like talking to [GordonGoner](https://x.com/GordonGoner), you can ask questions about onchain and offchain APE ecosystem:
- Market Insights: Live prices and on-chain data from CoinGecko and Etherscan.
- NFT Metrics: Real-time data from OpenSea (MagicEden is in progress).
- Governance Tracking: Direct integration with Discourse forums and Snapshot votes.
- Community Feeds: Updates from Twitter, Discord, and Discourse forums.
- Apecoin Metrics: Yield tracking and treasury analytics.
- Ecosystem Resources: Quick links to ApeChain dApps.

Here's a video demonstrating how to use the Ape Agent:
