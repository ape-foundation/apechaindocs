## About ApeChain RPC
Apechain RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a JSON-RPC interface that allows developers and applications to interact with Apechain nodes programmatically. It enables operations such as querying blockchain data (e.g., balances, blocks, and transactions) and submitting write operations (e.g., deploying smart contracts or sending transactions). Being EVM-compatible, Apechain RPC supports Ethereum-like methods, making it easy to use tools like ethers.js or web3.js for interaction.


## Running a replica node for ApeChain Mainnet

Please check out the [latest (v3.5.6) repository](https://github.com/ConstellationCrypto/replica-guide-apechain-mainnet) for an example of how to spin up a node locally. Simply run `docker-compose up` to bring a replica node up locally. 

The `nodeConfig` file is prepopulated with apechain parameters. The current setup uses a public rpc url for the Arbitrum One rpc and stores node data in docker volume. 

Replace the arbitrum one rpc url with your own to avoid being rate limited.

### Using the Repo

The repo is set up to easily run curtis testnet replica nodes. Simply run `docker-compose up` from the root of the repository to bring a replica node up locally.

The docker image for curtis testnet is hosted in a public docker repo: `public.ecr.aws/i6b2w2n6/nitro-node:curtis3`

The `nodeConfig` file included in the repository is prepopulated with curtis testnet parameters. The current setup uses a public rpc url for the Arbitrum Sepolia rpc and stores node data in ad Docker volume.

It is recommended to replace the Arbitrum Sepolia RPC URL in `docker-compose.yml` with your own private url to avoid ratelimiting issues, it's advised to use your private PRC URL instead of the default public one. By default, this value is set to Arbitrum's public RPC url.
