### Using the Repo

The repo is set up to easily run curtis testnet replica nodes. Simply run `docker-compose up` from the root of the repository to bring a replica node up locally.

The docker image for curtis testnet is hosted in a public docker repo: `public.ecr.aws/i6b2w2n6/nitro-node:curtis3`

The `nodeConfig` file included in the repository is prepopulated with curtis testnet parameters. The current setup uses a public rpc url for the Arbitrum Sepolia rpc and stores node data in ad Docker volume.

It is recommended to replace the Arbitrum Sepolia RPC URL in `docker-compose.yml` with your own private url to avoid ratelimiting issues, it's advised to use your private PRC URL instead of the default public one. By default, this value is set to Arbitrum's public RPC url.
