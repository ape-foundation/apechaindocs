## The Graph Network

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graph's infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of Indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.
 
With The Graph, you can benefit from:
 - **Decentralized Indexing, Built to Scale**: Tap into a global network of Indexers to efficiently index blockchain data with no single point of failure‚Äìjust resilient infrastructure. 
 - **Powerful GraphQL Interface**: Query blockchain data using GraphQL. It's fast and flexible, accelerating data retrieval to enhance your dapps. 
 - **Customizable Data Logic**: Define your own logic for transforming and storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers on The Graph Network.

Supported Networks
- ApeChain Mainnet
- ApeChain Curtis Testnet 
 
### Quick Start
 
These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up. Follow this [quick-start](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.
 
Pricing: **All developers receive 100K free monthly queries on the decentralized network**. After these free queries, you only pay based on usage at $2 for every 100K queries.



## Ormi 


[Ormi](https://www.ormilabs.xyz/) powers ApeChain subgraphs which are fully compatible with The Graph's hosted and decentralized networks, adhering to the same specifications. They seamlessly index data from both the ApeChain mainnet and testnets, allowing developers to easily build applications for ApeChain. Read more on how to create your [account](apechain.0xgraph.xyz) deploy your own [subgraph](https://docs.ormi.xyz/apechain-subgraphs) on ApeChain. 



For developers who are already familiar with Graph Protocol tooling, below are the network definitions to deploy subgraphs on ApeChain. These settings can be configured in the subgraph.yaml file.

{/* ``` solidity copy 
network: 'apechain'
```

```solidity copy
network: 'apechain-curtis'
``` */}


| Network  |        |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Mainnet  | `network: 'apechain'`       |
| Curtis   | `network: 'apechain-curtis'`|



## Goldsky
‚Äã
Goldsky is ApeChain's trusted partner for high-performance data indexing and streaming, making it easy for developers to power dApps, analytics, and AI agents with fast, reliable access to ApeChain's on-chain data.

Goldsky offers **two powerful products**:

### Subgraphs

[Subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/deploying-subgraphs) allow you to index ApeChain data into a highly optimized format for **instant, flexible querying**.

Use subgraphs when you want to **read and display on-chain data** inside apps, websites, dashboards, bots, and more.

- **Ultra-fast reads**: Query large volumes of on-chain data with millisecond response times.
- **Flexible GraphQL APIs**: Filter, paginate, and fetch exactly the data you need.
- **Custom indexing logic**: Handle complex event processing, join entities, build derived fields.
- **Auto-scaling**: Goldsky automatically scales infrastructure for you, no more worrying about node ops.
- **Instant Deployment**: Create subgraphs instantly by uploading your ABI and contract address, no GraphQL coding required (but you can fully customize if you want).

üõ†Ô∏è **Example Use Cases**:

- NFT marketplaces (fetching listings, offers, metadata)
- DeFi dashboards (tracking TVL, trades, positions)
- Social apps (aggregating profiles, posts, on-chain actions)
- In-game marketplaces (real-time item trades and player stats)

### Mirror

[Mirror](https://docs.goldsky.com/mirror/create-a-pipeline) is a real-time data streaming pipeline that **replicates ApeChain data into your own database**, letting you power complex backends, machine learning, or data analytics.

- **Real-time streaming**: Ingest new blocks, events, transactions as they happen.
- **Your schema, your rules**: Mirror supports flexible transformations and customizations.
- **Database integration**: Push to Postgres, Clickhouse, or your warehouse of choice.
- **Perfect for AI/ML**: Build embeddings, train models, and run inference on live blockchain data.

üõ†Ô∏è **Example Use Cases**:

- Powering AI agents with up-to-the-second on-chain awareness
- Building custom analytics dashboards
- Enabling real-time alerts and risk monitoring systems
- Aggregating on-chain activity into internal data lakes

## Why Goldsky for ApeChain Builders?

- Lightning-fast query speeds
- Real-time data pipelines
- No need to manage indexers or infra
- Instant onboarding with minimal config
- Trusted by major Web3 projects across DeFi, gaming, AI, and social
