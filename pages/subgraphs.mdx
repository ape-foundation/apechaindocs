## The Graph Network

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graph’s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of Indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.
 
With The Graph, you can benefit from:
 - **Decentralized Indexing, Built to Scale**: Tap into a global network of Indexers to efficiently index blockchain data with no single point of failure–just resilient infrastructure. 
 - **Powerful GraphQL Interface**: Query blockchain data using GraphQL. It’s fast and flexible, accelerating data retrieval to enhance your dapps. 
 - **Customizable Data Logic**: Define your own logic for transforming and storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers on The Graph Network.

Suported Networks
- ApeChain Mainnet
- ApeChian Curtis Testnet 
 
### Quick Start
 
These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up. To get started, follow this [quick-start](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.
 
Pricing: **All developers receive 100K free monthly queries on the decentralized network**. After these free queries, you only pay based on usage at $2 for every 100K queries.



## Ormi 


[Ormi](https://www.ormilabs.xyz/) powers ApeChain subgraphs which are fully compatible with The Graph's hosted and decentralized networks, adhering to the same specifications. They seamlessly index data from both the ApeChain mainnet and testnets, allowing developers to easily build applications for ApeChain. Read more on how to create your [account](apechain.0xgraph.xyz) deploy your own [subgraph](https://docs.ormi.xyz/apechain-subgraphs) on ApeChain. 



For developers who are already familiar with Graph Protocol tooling, below are the network definitions to deploy subgraphs on ApeChain. These settings can be configured in the subgraph.yaml file.

{/* ``` solidity copy 
network: 'apechain'
```

```solidity copy
network: 'apechain-curtis'
``` */}


| Network  |        |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Mainnet  | `network: 'apechain'`       |
| Curtis   | `network: 'apechain-curtis'`|






## Goldsky
​
[Goldsky](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/apechain) is a high-performance data indexing solution tailored for ApeChain, enabling seamless extraction, transformation, and loading of on-chain data to ApeChain's applications and analytics. It offers two core methods for accessing ApeChain data: subgraphs designed for high-performance queries, and 
mirror, providing real-time data replication pipelines.



| Network        | Subgraphs   | Mirror |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Mainnet | Yes |Yes |
| Curtis  |	Yes | Yes | 



Check out their [step by step guide](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/deploying-subgraphs) to learn how to deploy a [subgraph](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/apechain#subgraphs) and or [mirror](https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/apechain#mirror) for ApeChain. It covers deploying via CLI using a local subgraph configuration file and creating instant subgraphs by providing a contract address and its ABI.
