# ApePortal FAQ

#### This FAQ will help you utilize the portal and navigate both Bridge and Swap functionalities. 

<ExpandableCard title="What is ApeChain?">
ApeChain is a dedicated infrastructure layer designed to power the ApeCoin ecosystem. It's an Arbitrum Orbit chain that utilizes $APE as its native gas token, significantly enhancing $APE's utility and fostering a robust, dynamic economy. ApeChain focuses on ecosystem discovery, unique web3 rails, and top-of-funnel exposure to provide developers and users with the best possible blockchain experience.
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="What is the ApeChain API?">
The ApeChain API allows developers to interact with the ApeChain network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. It supports various operations such as smart contract deployment, transaction processing, and data retrieval, enabling developers to integrate ApeChain's functionality into their applications.

<ExpandableCard title="How do I bridge tokens to ApeChain?">
<Steps>

{<h3>Step 1</h3>}
  Connect your wallet to Ape Portal.

{<h3>Step 2</h3>} 
Choose the network and token you want to bridge. We recommend bridging APE from Ethereum Mainnet to ApeChain. You'll need ApeChain APE for gas on ApeChain Mainnet.

{<h3>Step 3</h3>}
If you're bridging APE to ApeChain, ensure the originating network is set to Ethereum Mainnet, and select the APE token.

<Callout type="info"> Note: Ape Portal also supports cross-chain swaps. This allows you to bridge Ethereum Mainnet ETH directly to ApeChain APE with an additional cross-chain swap fee. You can bridge almost any EVM-compatible token to ApeChain APE. </Callout>

{<h3>Step 4</h3>}
If needed, approve the token for the bridge transaction.

{<h3>Step 5</h3>}
Sign the transaction to start the bridge process.

{<h3>Step 6</h3>}
Once the transaction is complete, check your wallet or use <a href="https://apescan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>ApeScan</a> to verify your balance on ApeChain.

<ExpandableCard title="What’s the difference between bridging tokens and swapping tokens?">
  <p><b>Bridging tokens</b> involves transferring tokens from one blockchain to another. For example, if you want to move your tokens from Ethereum to ApeChain, the bridge will lock your tokens on the source chain and mint equivalent tokens on the destination chain. This ensures that the total supply of tokens stays consistent across both networks. Once bridged, you can use the tokens on the destination network.</p>
  <br></br>
  <p><b>Swapping tokens</b> refers to exchanging one token for another on the same blockchain network. This allows users to trade tokens based on current market rates using the Swap functionality within Ape Portal.</p>
   <br></br>
  <p><b>Cross-chain swaps</b> allow you to swap tokens across different blockchain networks. Ape Portal’s Bridge enables users to exchange an EVM-compatible currency for another, even if the tokens are on different networks. This feature is ideal for users looking to perform swaps as part of their cross-chain activity.</p>
       <br></br>
  <p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
     <br></br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bridging</strong> moves tokens between different chains.</li>
       <br></br>
    <li><strong>Swapping</strong> exchanges tokens within the same chain.</li>
       <br></br>
    <li><strong>Cross-chain swaps</strong> allow you to swap EVM-compatible tokens across different networks.</li>
  </ul>

<ExpandableCard title="How do I swap tokens on ApeChain?">
<Steps>
{<h3>Step 1</h3>}
Navigate to the Swap tab in the ApeChain Portal.

{<h3>Step 2</h3>}
Select the network where you'd like to perform the swap.

{<h3>Step 3</h3>}
Choose or search for the tokens you wish to swap. For example, you can swap APE for another token on ApeChain.

{<h3>Step 4</h3>}
Adjust the slippage tolerance if needed (the default is set to 1%).

Note: A slippage tolerance of 1% works well for most swaps. Be cautious with higher tolerances to avoid unfavorable trades.

{<h3>Step 5</h3>}
Confirm the swap and sign the transaction in your wallet.

{<h3>Step 6</h3>}
The swapped tokens will appear in your wallet balance once the transaction is complete.
</Steps>

<ExpandableCard title="How do I withdraw tokens from ApeChain?">
<Steps>
{<h3>Step 1</h3>}
Go to the Bridge tab and select ApeChain as the "From" network. Make sure to set the token to APE if you're withdrawing APE.

{<h3>Step 2</h3>}
Choose the destination network and the amount of APE (or other tokens) you want to withdraw.

{<h3>Step 3</h3>}
Sign the transaction to initiate the withdrawal.

{<h3>Step 4</h3>}
Once the required time has passed, confirm the transaction based on the destination network's processing time.

<Callout type="warning">  Note: Some canonical bridges, such as Arbitrum, have a 7-day withdrawal waiting period for security reasons. A canonical bridge is an official bridge managed by the network itself, ensuring token transfers maintain the same token standard and security. These bridges often have longer waiting periods to enhance security. Please pay attention to any withdrawal warnings in the Portal before signing. If you initiate a transaction with a 7-day withdrawal, it cannot be undone, and you must wait the full 7 days.</Callout>

For a faster option, you can initiate a faster withdrawal (cross-chain swap), which will complete more quickly.

</Steps>
</ExpandableCard>


<ExpandableCard title="How long do withdrawals take?">
Withdrawals from ApeChain can vary based on the destination network and the bridge route you choose. Fast-bridge withdrawals typically take a few minutes, while canonical bridge withdrawals can take up to 7 days. You can check the status of your transactions in DecentScan by clicking the Transactions link in the Portal, or by visiting  <a href="https://www.decentscan.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Decent Scan</a> and entering your wallet address.
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="How do I claim a canonical bridge withdrawal after the 7-day waiting period?">
If your withdrawal is ready to be claimed, a notification icon will appear within the Portal when the correct wallet is connected. Go to the Bridge tab, open the notification, and follow the link to claim your withdrawal on  <a href="https://www.decentscan.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Decent Scan</a>. Alternatively, you can monitor your transaction in Decent Scan and claim your withdrawal directly from their interface.
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="Why is my transaction gas fee high?">
If your gas fee seems unusually high, it could be due to network congestion or insufficient funds to cover both the transaction value and gas costs. You may want to try reducing the transaction amount or reviewing your gas settings.

<Callout type="info"> Note: We recommend only advanced users customize their gas settings. Incorrectly adjusting gas fees can lead to delays or failed transactions. For most users, it's best to leave the default gas settings or select one of the speed options provided by your web3 wallet.</Callout>
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="What are the Ape Portal platform transaction fees?">


| Fees   |                                                                      |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Bridge | 0.12% plus $0.20, with no fees for ApeChain canonical bridge routes. |
| Swap   |                          0.25% plus $0.20.                           |
| Onramp |                                1.00%.                                |

<Callout type="info"> Note: Platform transaction fees may vary by product and are subject to change based on network conditions, liquidity availability, or other external factors. While we strive to keep fees consistent, higher fees may occasionally apply in certain situations. Always review all transaction fees by clicking the dropdown before initiating any transactions.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">Please also note that the Ape Portal Onramp fee is in addition to the Moonpay or Transak onramp fee, which is set by the onramp provider.</Callout>
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="How do I see the status of my transaction?">
There are several ways to track your transaction status:

After submitting a transaction, click the "View Transaction" button to track its status on <a href="https://www.decentscan.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Decent Scan</a> .
For transactions on ApeChain, visit  <a href="https://apescan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>ApeScan</a>  and enter your transaction hash.
For all other transactions, visit <a href="https://www.decentscan.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Decent Scan</a>  and paste your transaction hash.
<Callout type="info">Note: If you don’t know your transaction hash, you can find your transactions on both ApeScan and DecentScan by pasting in your wallet address.</Callout>

</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="What is slippage tolerance?">
Slippage tolerance refers to the maximum percentage difference you're willing to accept between the expected price of a token swap and the actual price at which the swap is executed. If the market price moves beyond your set tolerance during the transaction, it will not complete.

For most users, a default slippage tolerance of 1% works well. However, in highly volatile markets or low liquidity situations, you may need to adjust the tolerance to ensure your transaction goes through.

<Callout type="info">Note: Be cautious when increasing slippage tolerance. Setting it too high may result in less favorable trade rates, potentially leading to losses. It is generally advisable to keep slippage low unless you are familiar with the risks.</Callout>

</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="What if my transaction fails?">
If your transaction fails, check your wallet on the originating network to confirm whether your tokens have been returned. In most cases, failed transactions automatically result in the tokens being returned to your wallet. Be sure to carefully review any warnings in the Ape Portal or your Web3 wallet before signing a transaction.
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title=" Why would my transaction fail?">
Transaction failures typically occur when gas prices spike unexpectedly or when the slippage tolerance is set too low. Ensure your gas settings are sufficient, and adjust the slippage tolerance if necessary.

<Callout type="warning">Note: Be cautious when manually adjusting slippage tolerance. A lower tolerance may prevent the transaction from completing if the price fluctuates too much, which is intentional to protect against unfavorable trades.</Callout>
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="My transaction says it is confirmed, but I don’t see the tokens. Where are they?">
Occasionally, there may be a delay in reflecting transactions in your balance due to network congestion. Check the  <a href="https://apescan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>ApeScan</a>   or  <a href="https://www.decentscan.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  style={{ color: '#207ee0', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Decent Scan</a>   for real-time transaction updates.
</ExpandableCard>

<ExpandableCard title="What are the warning or error messages?">

<b>INSUFFICIENT FUNDS:</b> You don’t have enough of the "From" token to complete a bridge or swap transaction, or you're lacking the native gas token on the "From" network. For example, bridging or swapping $APE ERC-20 on Ethereum requires both $APE and $ETH, as $ETH is used to pay for gas fees.


<b>BAD FROM OR TO CHAINS:</b> This error indicates that the source and destination chains are incompatible (e.g., using a Mainnet chain for the "From" network and a Testnet chain for the "To" network). Solution: Ensure both chains are compatible (e.g., both Mainnet or both Testnet).

<b>SOMETHING WENT WRONG:</b> This may occur due to network issues, or the Decent.xyz API might be temporarily unavailable. Try again with a different combination of tokens or networks.
